# LED's assembly for the glow ring.

## Soldering of the glow ring

The glow ring requires 10 white LED's soldered in a circular ring shape, The 10 LED's have to be soldered in parallel config, meaning plus is soldered to plus and minus is soldered to minus all around the ring, that way a 3.3V supply can power them all.

Now for some and many, it might be dificult to solder 10 leds in a circle by freehanding it, well, not wo worry, I have included a jig for you to print and use, it allows you to mount the LED's in a upright possiston for a better and easy solder job, and also allows you to solder them in a circular ring shape.

The jig can be found [Here](https://github.com/ProgramFreakHD/Tony-Stark-s-Arc-Reactor-MK1/tree/main/Led%20jig)!

## Center LED

The LED I used for the center of the arc reactor is a 3.3V cool white (6500k) star shaped PCB LED, nothing special with the way it's mounted, I have included a center LED plate in the thingiverse repo for you to print and mount the star led on.

# Wire wrap and mounting

Insert the Led ring you just finished soldering into the transparent glow ring print, from there, you need the 10pcs wire brackets and some enameled copper wire. Don't forget to solder a pair of enameled copper wire to the led ring to provide power to the ring.

To obtain the enameled copper wire, you can find meters worth of copper wires in some old transformers, or just buy some enameled copper wire from the web.

To keep the copper wire from unwinding itself after a wrap, the best and easiest way I found is to scrape the enameling of the wire and solder the wires together for a secure fixturing.

# Power supply for the LED's

To power the LED's a 3.3V power source is required for the LED, for my arc reactor I used 20 to 40 ohm resistor to drop down the power start with 20 ohms resistor and work yourself upwards, you can use a 3.3v powered led as a referance point as to what it sould look like, also make sure you test out the resistor on a spare led so you don't accidentally fry the main arc reactor LEDs.
